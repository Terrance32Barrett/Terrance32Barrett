## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a data engineer focused on building robust, scalable data transformation pipelines using dbt (Data Build Tool) and Snowflake. This repository is a collection of my work with modern data stack tools, showcasing how I model, clean, and transform raw data into analytics-ready assets.

My work centers on the belief that clean, well-documented data is the foundation of reliable decision-making. With dbt, Iâ€™m able to write modular SQL transformations, apply version control to data models, and build clear lineage documentationâ€”all while enabling analytics teams to trust the data they work with. I'm especially interested in leveraging dbt's testing, documentation, and incremental model features to enforce data quality and transparency across pipelines.

On the warehouse side, I use Snowflake for its speed, scalability, and separation of compute and storage. Iâ€™m learning how to optimize queries, manage warehouse costs, and work with semi-structured data formats like JSON. I also explore Snowflake features like streams and tasks for real-time and scheduled transformations.

This repository includes sample dbt projects, staging and mart layer examples, Jinja macros, and custom testsâ€”everything I use to practice building well-structured, maintainable transformation layers. Each project is focused on solving real-world data challenges, such as consolidating siloed data sources, cleaning inconsistent fields, and creating reusable data models for analytics.

As I continue learning and building, Iâ€™m committed to writing clear, tested code and adopting best practices in data engineering workflows. If youâ€™re working with dbt, Snowflake, or the broader modern data stack, feel free to browse, contribute, or connectâ€”Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building trusted data pipelines, one model at a time.
